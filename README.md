# Web Development Site

This project is an effort to show my habilities and my Web Development proggress in years. I'm very proud of myself, because, I came from Network Area, and Web Development was not in my plans, however, life is a surprise box.

# First experience with Development

My first experiences was not in Web Development, but in proggraming for automation, so Shell Script, Python and NodeJS was in my focus. I didn't gave up on them, once all of them has great funcionalities, however, for Web Development, I think PHP is more efficient, has a greate community, it's very powerfull and it's not difficult to understand and learn.

I started proggramin when TR069 protocol's was presented to me. Back in time, the enterprise asked me to implement ACS's service into the network, and so I did it, working with GenieACS, that was built in NodeJS, which it's powerfull, and it was in my focus that time.

I started to work with Python when I implement Zabbix in the enterprise's network. Python it's greate too.

Shell Script it's one of my favorite languages. With it, I create sites with CGI Apache, which was one of my classes in FliSol, in Palmares, Pernambuco, I create filter package netfilter/iptables script, with a dynamic package's verification, I implement dynamic update GNU/Linux servers, I implement log's verification and so on... Shell Script it's a greate language, besides has some limitations.
